<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

#### I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Architecture at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China. I conduct my research in the Information Storage and Applications Laboratory, advised by Prof. YuchongHu, and I am also affiliated with Prof. Dan Feng's research group. I am expected to graduate in May 2026.


#### Previously, I received my M.Eng. in Computer Technology from the School of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. To date, I have (co-)authored 12+ research papers, including 6 as the first or corresponding author, in venues such as ICDE2026, HPDC2025, HPDC2024, CADCG2021, and ICV2022.
